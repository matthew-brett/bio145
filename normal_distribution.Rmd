# The normal distribution


This is a Jupyter Notebook.  It can be run as an interactive demo.

The Notebook contains *cells*.  This is a *text* cell.  The next cell is a *code* cell.

Press the Shift key with the Enter (or Return) key to execute a cell and move to the next cell.

You can also run a cell with the Run icon at the top of the Window.

```{python}
# Execute this cell by pressing Shift and Enter at the same time.
# Libraries for plotting, statistical distributions
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# %matplotlib inline
import scipy.stats as sps
```

```{python}
# Make plots look a little bit more fancy
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
```

We sample one million values from a normal distribution.  The distribution has a mean of 0 and a *standard deviation* of 1.

```{python}
number_of_values = 1000000
values = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=number_of_values)
```

Plot these as a histogram with 100 bins:

```{python}
plt.hist(values, bins=100);
```

What proportion of values are between -1.96 and +1.96?

```{python}
left_threshold = -1.96
right_threshold = 1.96
betweens = (values >= left_threshold) & (values <= right_threshold)
# Propotion of values between -1.96 and 1.96
np.count_nonzero(betweens) / number_of_values
```

This proportion - around 95% - is characteristic of the normal distribution.


What if the distribution doesn't have a mean of 0 or a standard deviation of 1?

```{python}
values_around_10 = np.random.normal(10, 3, size=number_of_values)
```

```{python}
plt.hist(values_around_10, bins=100);
```

Now the center is at 10, and one standard deviation to the left of center is 10 - 3 = 7.


The rule above works by multiplying the standard deviation by 1.96, and subtracting / adding to the mean.

```{python}
left_threshold = 10 - 3 * 1.96
right_threshold = 10 + 3 * 1.96
betweens_around_10 = (values_around_10 >= left_threshold) & (values_around_10 <= right_threshold)
# Propotion of values between -1.96 and 1.96 standard deviations
np.count_nonzero(betweens_around_10) / number_of_values
```

## What's special about the normal distribution


Let's get some values from several not-normal distributions.

```{python}
first_skewed = np.random.gamma(size=number_of_values)
plt.hist(first_skewed, bins=100);
```

```{python}
second_skewed = np.random.chisquare(2, size=number_of_values)
plt.hist(second_skewed, bins=100);
```

```{python}
third_skewed = np.random.gumbel(20, size=number_of_values)
plt.hist(third_skewed, bins=100);
```

```{python}

```
